This case study involves the design and implementation of an MPLS network to transport critical IoT
services, as well as data and voice services. GNS3 will be used to emulate the MPLS network under
different scenarios, and performance comparisons will be made for each scenario. The simulation will include
a minimum of 300 IoT sensors to evaluate the traffic from connected devices.
